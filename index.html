  <h1>Human Perplexity Test</h1>
  <p>Here's the game: You can only see two characters of the passage at first. You need to guess the next character, by typing it. (Just type it!) Your choices are the letters of the English alphabet (case insensitive) together with the space, comma, and period. That's 29 possibilities for every character. The correct text appears here:</p>
  <h2><span id="correct" style="background-color: #99CCFF; font-family: monospace"></span>&nbsp;</h2>
  <p>What you enter will appear here:</p>
  <h2><span id="entered" style="font-family: monospace;"></span>&nbsp;</h2>
  <p>If you're on mobile or whatever, you can type in here: <input type="text" /><br />(Zoom out again, and don't worry about auto-correct.)</p>
  <h3>attempted <span id="attempted">0</span> of <span id="passage_length"></span> characters; <span id="num_correct">0</span> correct<span id="incomplete1"> [incomplete]</span></h3>
  <h3><span id="incomplete2">[so far] </span>you're like a die with <span id="perplexity">[unknown]</span> sides (your <a href="http://planspace.org/2013/09/23/perplexity-what-it-is-and-what-yours-is/"><i>perplexity</i></a>)</h3>
  <p>(Computers can get 3.4, no problem, so you should certainly get lower than that.)
